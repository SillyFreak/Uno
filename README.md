Uno
=======

Play the game Uno over the network, using the Harmonic synchronization
library and the JGrouos networking library.

Uno is interesting in the sense that it contains many aspects also found in
collectible card games:

- a variable number of players
- a modifiable turn order
- multiple zones where cards can reside, including public, private and hidden
  zones
- different kinds of cards that require the player to make extra decisions

of course, it lacks some common aspects:

- strategic decisions that require an AI to really "think" about their decisions
- introducing new objects/cards into the game
